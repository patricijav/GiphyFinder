### Getting started

To run the app locally, you must create a file (`GiphyFinder/Secrets.plist`) and add a
key-value pair to it, that is, key with name `GiphyAPIKey` and a string value containing
your Giphy API key.

Note: if you do not have a Giphy API key, go to the Giphy Developers portal, create an
account and create an API key for iOS.

### Figma
Before creating the app I planned it out in Figma. To view it [see this link](https://www.figma.com/design/6qbZBGtM3tsyMn0tQPS7VJ/GiphyFinder-by-Patricia)
or just take a look at the screenshot below.

### Solution details
Solution was built and ran on Xcode version 15.4, macOS version 14.5, Swift 5.10.

Used SDWebImage as a package dependency to display individual GIFs. Other libraries, for
example, JellyGIF, might be faster, but SDWebImage is popular and stable.

The code handles multiple errors, but displays on the screen the following errors: too
many symbols in the search field, no internet connection. Additionally we could handle
and display more errors, for example, Giphy is down (>= 500 status code), API request
limit reached (max 100 calls per hour, status code 429), Giphy API key isn't set or
too many GIFs loaded (Giphy API max offset is 4999 and max limit is 50, that would make
the maximum 5049 or 5000 if we round down).

High quality GIFs are displayed also in the grid view, this was done to increase the
loading time, to see better how the loading indicator works. In the final version lower
quality GIFs should be used in the grid, and higher quality GIFs should be used in the
detailed view.

Code uses the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture pattern.
